My Rpg game:

Almost done with: 
- scriptable object enemies, enemy classes and so on.

things to start working on:
inventory system (Started, still need to add on to the itemCreator menu system)
cleaning up in the player and enemy script (Started, enemyscript done, player not)
Pausemenu (Done)
Startmenu (Done)
Healthbar (Done, just a bug with text not always fitting inside the bar)
exp bar (Done)
LevelUpSystem (done, fade in script and all)
Rpg classes for players ( not done ).
floating text (Almost done, just need to offset position so numbers dont fly over eachother and need to make animation for if its a player (downgoing movement instead of upgoing))
More Cursor textures (Default is set, missing enemy cursor and vendor cursor / possible find out how to set outline on objets depending on what tag it has, enemy = red and so on)
Enemy states redo (done)

Enemy to take damage again with the new healthsystem (notdone)

Focus points:
- Object pooling (made one, else look on asset store)
- inventory system (make items stackable, make consumable items able to be used and remove 1 item from stack)
- floating text position fix ( now bugged, instaniates 4x of 1 object pr damage / heal)
