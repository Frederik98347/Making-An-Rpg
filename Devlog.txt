- scriptable object enemies, enemy classes and so on.

things to start working on:
inventory system (not started)
cleaning up in the player and enemy script (not done)
Pausemenu (Done)
Startmenu (Done)
Healthbar (Done, just a bug with text not always fitting inside the bar)
exp bar (Done)
LevelUpSystem (done, fade in script and all)
Rpg classes for players ( not done ).

Focus points:
