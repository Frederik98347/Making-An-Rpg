My Rpg game:

Almost done with: 
- scriptable object enemies, enemy classes and so on.

things to start working on:
inventory system (not started)
cleaning up in the player and enemy script (not done)
Pausemenu (Done)
Startmenu (Done)
Healthbar (Done, just a bug with text not always fitting inside the bar)
exp bar (Done)
LevelUpSystem (done, fade in script and all)
Rpg classes for players ( not done ).
floating text (not done)
Enemy states redo (done)
Bug: When you are set to idle state animations dont work, and attacking state still doesnt work either

Focus points:

- GUI frames
- floating text
